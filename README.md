# Welcome

Hey! Glad to see you are interested in integrating with Zerion. We've built an [interface](https://app.zerion.io/?utm\_medium=docs\&utm\_source=docs\&utm\_campaign=api\&utm\_content=external\&utm\_term=web) is your smart, social wallet for Web3. Start from scratch, import your existing wallets, and manage your crypto portfolio from one place â€“ including DeFi positions, NFTs, bridging across 10+ chains, swaps, and more. Available on all devices.

We're happy to share the tools that made Zerion possible. Find some options below on how we can work together. If you need some inspiration, check out our [Featured Partners](featured-partners.md) section.
